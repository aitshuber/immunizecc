		    Despite having vaccines that prevent more than 20 life-threatening diseases, those diseases have not gone away. The number of people receiving routine vaccinations has dropped for the first time in a decade. Texas is ground-zero for the anti-vaccination movement, putting our children and our communities at great risk for disease outbreaks, such as measles and chicken pox.&nbsp;<br /><br />Texans want to prevent vaccine-preventable diseases.&nbsp;&nbsp;

	  The Texas anti-vaccination community, with the help of statewide political operatives, built a<br />different political and legislative advocacy power base. National anti-vaccination leaders laid eyes on<br />Texas and settled in Austin. More Texas families are opting their children out from one or more school<br />required vaccines, leading to an increase in vaccine exemptions. The Department of State Health Services<br />reports families filed more than 76,000 vaccine exemptions for one or more school required vaccines in<br />the 2021-22 school year.
