        The Immunization Partnership (TIP) is a trusted resource for information
        and engagement in public policy that affects immunization. TIP works
        with organizations and coalitions around Texas to encourage active
        engagement in the public policy process—and to accelerate
        participation—resulting in a more engaged supporter network.

          Lives have been saved because of laws passed that preserved and
          increased access to vaccines that prevent diseases like measles,
          meningitis, and polio. We not only help draft proposed state
          legislation but we also work with state agency officials to shape how
          a law is implemented.&nbsp;<br><br>**[VISIT OUR ONLINE LEGISLATIVE

          We educate lawmakers about our positions on vaccine legislation and
          the impact and consequences to public health. TIP provides vital
          expertise and perspectives to state government decision-makers to
          craft improved laws and policies.
