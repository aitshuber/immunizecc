        text: >-
          <br>Immunization has protected Texans for generations, yet a small
          vocal group is spreading misinformation about vaccines that is putting
          our health at risk.<br/><br>We cannot afford to lose ground in our
          fight to protect Texans from preventable disease. Our <strong>
          IMMUNIZATION CHAMPIONS</strong> help ensure that more Texans across
          our state have factual information about vaccines and immunization –
          providing them with all they need to stay safe and healthy. <br>
