We cannot afford to lose ground in our effort to protect people from preventable disease. The more people across the state that help educate others about the benefits of immunization, the less likely we are to face resurgences of diseases like measles, mumps, and meningitis. The more people, like you, who become part of our BOOST TEXAS team, the more helpful, factual information we can provide to more people in more communitiesâ€¦and the more lives we can save.
