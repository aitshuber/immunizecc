#### 2023 Texas Legislative Session&nbsp;***BILL WATCH******&nbsp;***

<br>**We have carefully monitored the nearly 50 immunization-related bills filed this year at the State Capitol in Austin. Now, with only weeks left until the Legislative Session gavels to a close, The Immunization Partnership is paying close attention to four particular bills that are on the move. These four bills would have harmful and far-reaching implications for public health, negative impacts on families and communities, and unintended consequences for the business sector and our state’s economic strength.&nbsp;**

Bill Author: Brian Birdwell (R-Granbury)<br>Senate Bill (SB) 29 prohibits face covering mandates, vaccine mandates, and closures of private businesses and schools.&nbsp; The bill establishes an ominous blueprint for future pandemic response and interferes with businesses’ ability to protect employees and customers and schools’ ability to protect teachers, staff, and students.&nbsp;<br><br>*<u>BILL STATUS</u>\: PENDING IN* ***[HOUSE STATE AFFAIRS COMMITTEE](https://capitol.texas.gov/Committees/MembershipCmte.aspx?LegSess=88R&amp;CmteCode=C450){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}***

Bill Author: Mayes Middleton (R-Galveston)<br>Senate Bill 177 requires health care providers to obtain informed consent from patients receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.&nbsp; It prohibits coercion from physicians and nurses, which is not consistent with the practices of the vast majority of health care providers. It also penalizes businesses for requiring immunization against COVID-19 and offers for religious and medical exemptions, undercutting the rights and liberty of businesses to set health and wellness policies appropriate for their settings.&nbsp;<br><br>*<u>BILL STATUS</u>\: HOUSE PUBLIC HEALTH COMMITTEE REPORT SENT TO* ***[HOUSE CALENDARS COMMITTEE](https://capitol.texas.gov/Committees/MembershipCmte.aspx?LegSess=88R&amp;CmteCode=C050){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}***
