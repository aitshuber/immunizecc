##### 2023 Texas Legislative Session
{: .text-center}

#### ***BILL WATCH******&nbsp;***<br>
{: .text-center}

We have carefully monitored the nearly 50 immunization-related bills filed this year at the State Capitol in Austin. Now, with only weeks left until the Legislative Session gavels to a close, The Immunization Partnership is paying close attention to four particular anti-immunization bills that are on the move. These four bills would have harmful and far-reaching implications for public health, negative impacts on families and communities, and unintended consequences for the business sector and our state’s economic strength.&nbsp;



#### **[HOUSE BILL 44](https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/Text.aspx?LegSess=88R&amp;Bill=HB44){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}&nbsp;**

House Bill 44&nbsp;denies Medicaid/CHIP reimbursement to doctors who require their patients be immunized to protect other vulnerable patients, such as infants who are too young to be vaccinated and immunocompromised patients undergoing chemotherapy.<br>*​​​​​​**BILL STATUS: PENDING IN SENATE HEALTH & HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE***<br>

#### **[SENATE BILL 29](https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=88R&amp;Bill=SB29){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}**

Senate Bill (SB) 29 prohibits face covering mandates, vaccine mandates, and closures of private businesses and schools.&nbsp; The bill establishes an ominous blueprint for future pandemic response and interferes with businesses’ ability to protect employees and customers and schools’ ability to protect teachers, staff, and students.<br>***BILL STATUS: PENDING IN HOUSE STATE AFFAIRS COMMITTEE***

<br>**[SENATE BILL 177](https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=88R&amp;Bill=SB177){: target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"}**<br>Senate Bill 177 requires health care providers to obtain informed consent from patients receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.&nbsp; It prohibits coercion from physicians and nurses, which is not consistent with the practices of the vast majority of health care providers. It also penalizes businesses for requiring immunization against COVID-19 and offers for religious and medical exemptions, undercutting the rights and liberty of businesses to set health and wellness policies appropriate for their settings.<br>***BILL STATUS: HOUSE PUBLIC HEALTH COMMITTEE REPORT SENT TO CALENDARS COMMITTEE***

<br>[**SENATE BILL 1024**](https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=88R&amp;Bill=SB1024){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}<br>This bill has wide-ranging implications for public health and businesses.&nbsp; SB 1024 would:

* Shift school immunization decision making from medical experts at the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) to elected politicians.
* &nbsp;Prohibit DSHS from adding new immunization requirements in the event of future vaccine-preventable outbreaks.
* Punish health care facilities by withholding Medicaid funding and obstruct health care service delivery to Medicaid and CHIP recipients.
* Undercut the rights and liberty of businesses and government operations to set necessary health and wellness policies.
