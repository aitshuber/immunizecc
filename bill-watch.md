#### 2023 Texas Legislative Session&nbsp;***BILL WATCH******&nbsp;***

<br>**We have carefully monitored the nearly 50 immunization-related bills filed this year at the State Capitol in Austin. Now, with only weeks left until the Legislative Session gavels to a close, The Immunization Partnership is paying close attention to four particular bills that are on the move. These four pieces of legislation would have harmful and far-reaching implications for public health, negative impacts on families and communities, and unintended consequences for the business sector and our state’s economic strength.&nbsp;**

Bill Author: Mayes Middleton (R-Galveston)<br>Senate Bill 177 requires health care providers to obtain informed consent from patients receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.&nbsp; It prohibits coercion from physicians and nurses, which is not consistent with the practices of the vast majority of health care providers. It also penalizes businesses for requiring immunization against COVID-19 and offers for religious and medical exemptions, undercutting the rights and liberty of businesses to set health and wellness policies appropriate for their settings.&nbsp;<br><br>*<u>BILL STATUS</u>\: PLACED ON THE* &nbsp;***[HOUSE GENERAL STATE CALENDAR](https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/88R/calendars/html/H120230523.htm){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}***
