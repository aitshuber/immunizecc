      text: >-
        Texas is a big state with a vast population living in a variety of
        regions â€“ each with distinct health needs and challenges. Because
        protecting all Texans from preventable diseases requires a variety of
        innovative approaches, we created an extensive network that connects a
        diverse group of remarkable leaders and experts to increase immunization
        in all corners of the state.&nbsp;&nbsp;
