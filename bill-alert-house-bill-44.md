      #### House Bill (HB) 44 punishes Medicaid physicians who want to ensure
      their patients are safe from vaccine preventable diseases. The bill denies
      Medicaid reimbursement to physicians who require their patients be
      vaccinated.

      * #### The bill affects how doctors practice medicine and their goal of
      protecting patients they care for.


      * #### Immunocompromised children, such as children with leukemia and
      newborns and infants who are too young to receive immunizations, are
      vulnerable to the spread of infectious diseases from those who have not
      been immunized.

      * #### Immunization is a simple, cost-effective public health strategy
      that has saved countless lives and millions of dollars to the health care
      system.

      * #### HB 44 undermines access to care for low-income children. Families
      who refuse to vaccinate tend to reside in higher income areas and use
      commercial insurance at higher rates, making it easier for them to
      transition to a new provider than those on CHIP and Medicaid.

      * #### Texas already struggles recruiting physicians to accept Medicaid
      patients due to administrative burdens. The state should encourage more
      providers to provide care for children, not add more burdens.
