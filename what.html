      text: >-
        The Immunization Partnership works to significantly increase state
        immunization rates by being a source of leading research, industry
        expertise and specialist knowledge; keeping communities informed of
        vaccination benefits and advising them on how they can use that
        knowledge to promote change; and advocating at the Texas Legislature for
        public policy that improves access to vaccination and permits healthcare
        professionals to build healthy communities.
