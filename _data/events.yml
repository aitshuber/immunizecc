    TIP is excited to announce our first immunization art exhibit entitled, The
    Art of Awareness: A Community’s Self-Portrait of Immunization Health, taking
    place from May 6th - May 27th, which highlights pieces created by local
    Houston artists. The purpose of the exhibit is to showcase and prompt a
    dialogue about the important role vaccines play as a part of a person’s
    holistic health and the health of the community. In collaboration with MECA
    Dow Campus located in historic 6th Ward, our goal is to enrich the community
    through engagement, art, and direct action.
