- Name: Jamie Schanbaum
  Text: >-
    Jamie Schanbaum was a sophomore at The University of Texas at Austin (UT)
    when she contracted meningococcal septicemia, a severe blood infection
    caused by the same bacteria as meningitis. The symptoms appeared in the
    evening and by the next day she was unable to move her legs. The loss of
    blood flow to Jamie’s extremities allowed for bacteria to gradually kill her
    limbs, resulting in amputation of her fingers and both legs below the knee.
    Jamie and her family advocated with TIP and others to require meningitis
    vaccinations for all incoming freshmen. The Jamie Schanbaum Nicolis Williams
    Act creates awareness to the threat of bacterial meningitis and brings us
    one step closer to preventing unnecessary deaths and suffering. Thankfully,
    her tragedy did not stop her. She won a gold medal in the USA Cycling
    Paralympic Road National Championships. Jamie graduated from UT with a
    degree in Human and Family Development. Today, she works diligently across
    the country to advocate for meningitis awareness and vaccination uptake.

- Name: Greg Williams
  Text: >-
    Greg Williams is the father of Nicolis “Nico” Williams, a Texas A&M student
    who died February 11, 2011, from bacterial meningitis. Prior to Nico’s
    death, Texas only required students living in dorms to have meningitis
    vaccinations. Even though Nico did not live in a dorm, the limited vaccine
    requirement was a contributing factor to his death. Greg and his family
    advocated with TIP and others to require meningitis vaccinations for all
    incoming freshmen. The Jamie Schanbaum Nicolis Williams Act creates
    awareness to the threat of bacterial meningitis and brings us one step
    closer to preventing unnecessary deaths and suffering. You can learn more

- Name: Riki Graves
  Text: >-
    Riki is the mother of a daughter who, at 17-days-old, was the youngest heart
    transplant recipient at Texas Children’s Hospital. Because she is a
    transplant recipient and cannot receive certain vaccines, immunization and
    community immunity are critical to her health and survival. Riki partnered
    with TIP and Immunize Texas to walk the halls of the Texas Capitol and
    educate lawmakers about the life-saving and life-changing importance of
    vaccines. TIP worked with Riki to provide testimony during public hearings
    to support pro-vaccine bills and to oppose anti-vaccine legislative efforts.
