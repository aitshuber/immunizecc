- Name: Jamie Schanbaum
  Text: Jamie Schanbaum was a sophomore at The University of Texas at Austin (UT) when she contracted meningococcal septicemia, a severe blood infection caused by the same bacteria as meningitis. The symptoms appeared in the evening and by the next day she was unable to move her legs. The loss of blood flow to Jamie’s extremities allowed for bacteria to gradually kill her limbs, resulting in amputation of her fingers and both legs below the knee. Jamie and her family advocated with TIP and others to require meningitis vaccinations for all incoming freshmen. The Jamie Schanbaum Nicolis Williams Act creates awareness to the threat of bacterial meningitis and brings us one step closer to preventing unnecessary deaths and suffering. Thankfully, her tragedy did not stop her. She won a gold medal in the USA Cycling Paralympic Road National Championships. Jamie graduated from UT with a degree in Human and Family Development. Today, she works diligently across the country to advocate for meningitis awareness and vaccination uptake. Learn more at www.thejamiegroup.org.

- Name: Greg Williams
  Text: Greg Williams is the father of Nicolis “Nico” Williams, a Texas A&M student who died February 11, 2011, from bacterial meningitis. Prior to Nico’s death, Texas only required students living in dorms to have meningitis vaccinations. Even though Nico did not live in a dorm, the limited vaccine requirement was a contributing factor to his death. Greg and his family advocated with TIP and others to require meningitis vaccinations for all incoming freshmen. The Jamie Schanbaum Nicolis Williams Act creates awareness to the threat of bacterial meningitis and brings us one step closer to preventing unnecessary deaths and suffering.
