<div><div>Coalitions are instrumental in promoting and raising immunization rates at the local level, which helps keep all of Texas protected from outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. TIP’s Building Coalitions across Texas (BCaT) project fosters the incubation, growth, and development of coalitions to improve immunization policies and services at local and statewide levels.</div></div>
