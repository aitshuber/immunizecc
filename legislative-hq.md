          Texas state lawmakers meet at the Capitol in Austin for 150 days every
          two years for the Legislative Session. Texas has a bicameral
          legislature, which means there are two chambers - the House and the
          Senate.&nbsp; One hundred and fifty state lawmakers serve in the
          House, and they are led by Speaker Dade Phelan. Lieutenant Governor
          Dan Patrick presides in the 31 member Senate.
