**The Texas Legislature 101**

The Immunization Partnership educates lawmakers about the importance of raising statewide immunization rates to ensure vaccine-preventable diseases do not gain a foothold in Texas. This type of advocacy involves meeting with lawmakers at the Texas State Capitol on a regular basis to discuss the critical importance of vaccines in protecting public health, explain the role of The Immunization Partnership in disseminating vaccine facts and information and dispelling myths, and encourage support for sound public policies that protect all Texans. It is essential to raise our voices in support of immunizing against vaccine-preventable diseases so children reach their full potential, families thrive, and communities flourish. Achieving this goal requires participation in the legislative process. How does this process work in Texas?

**The Legislature**

The Texas legislature meets for 140 days every other odd-numbered year. During this compressed time period, lawmakers consider hundreds of bills, formulate the state budget, and revise laws that already in effect. The legislature has two chambers: the Texas House of Representatives and the Texas Senate.

The Texas House has 150 members who serve two-year terms. They choose one of their own members to be speaker of the House. In addition to keeping order and other functions, the Speaker appoints committees, committee chairs, and vice-chairs. Speaker Dade Phelan occupies this role during the 88th Legislative Session in 2023.

The Texas Senate has 31 members who serve four-year terms. The President of the Texas Senate is the Lieutenant Governor who Texas voters choose. The Lieutenant Governor leads the upper chamber and votes to break a tie or when the entire Senate convenes. Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick serves in this capacity for the 88th Legislative Session and appoints committees, committee chairs, and vice chairs.

**Proposing bills**

After procedural rules established by the Speaker of the House and Lieutenant Governor are adopted, representatives and senators begin to contemplate bills that constitute new laws or change current ones. Legislators gather ideas for bills from their constituents, advocacy organizations such as The Immunization Partnership, or formulate their own recommendations. When not in session, committee members produce interim reports that may also include proposals for new legislation or amendments to existing statute. Bills can be written by legislators or the Legislative Council, a nonpartisan agency that conducts research and assists legislative offices with bill drafting. Once written, the bill’s caption is read to members of the chamber in which it was introduced. After this first reading, the bill is assigned to a relevant committee.

**Committee activities**

The chair of a committee determines which bills will be considered and when. In the House, public testimony during committee hearings offers citizens the opportunity to weigh in on an issue. During public hearings, committee members may also take legislative action. Alternatively, committee members may meet to take legislative action without hearing public testimony. House committees can conduct work sessions that only involve discussion. Invited testimony is taken from public officials representing state agencies, local government officials, experts, academics, and other witnesses. In the Senate, public testimony may be heard at any meeting. Legislative action can also be taken during any meeting.

A bill may “die” in committee, with no further action taken on the proposed legislation. When a bill advances, the committee produces a report on the bill which contains recommendations, a record of the committee’s vote, the bill text, and a fiscal note outlining budget implications. In the House, the committee’s report is sent to the Calendars Committee which places the proposed legislation on a calendar for deliberation by the full House. In the Senate, bills are placed on a schedule in the order in which they are reported out of committee

**Floor Action**

A bill receives a second reading before the full House or Senate at which point the bill is debated by the applicable chamber. A member may suggest an amendment to the bill, and a majority of members present must approve the amendment for the bill to be revised. The bill is then put up for a vote. There is a third reading with more deliberation, and final passage. The bill is engrossed in the originating chamber and a marked-up version of the bill is sent to the other chamber for consideration, generally adhering to the same process.

**Final Steps**

If the bill is returned to the originating chamber without amendments, it is signed by the Speaker of the House and the Lieutenant Governor and transmitted to the Governor. If the bill sent back with amendments, a conference committee may convene to work out differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill. If there is agreement, the bill is signed by the Speaker of the House and Lieutenant Governor, enrolled, and sent to the Governor. The Governor can sign the bill or permit the bill to become law without signing. In cases when the Governor vetoes legislation, the bill goes back to the originating chamber with an explanation of the reason(s). There must be a two-thirds majority vote to override the veto.

**Conclusion**

Civic participation is a crucial pillar of a functioning society. By understanding the legislative process in Texas and forging connections with lawmakers, the public can influence decisions that create positive change in communities across the state. TIP stands ready to be a voice for Texans who want to prevent disease and work for sensible and reasonable immunization policies. With the support of vaccine allies, we can ensure all Texans live safe and healthy lives.
