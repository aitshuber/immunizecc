          Coalitions are instrumental in promoting and raising immunization
          rates at the local level, which helps keep all of Texas protected from
          outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. TIP’s Building Coalitions
          across Texas (BCaT) project fosters the incubation, growth, and
          development of coalitions to improve immunization policies and
          services at local and statewide levels.


          TIP provides technical assistance and consultation services for 10
          immunization coalitions in the following cities and counties: Andrews
          County, Gregg County, El Paso, Houston, Lubbock, McAllen, Midland, San
          Antonio, Smith County, Tarrant County, and Tyler.


          The BCaT Network is an online community for Texas immunization
          coalitions to network and share coalition resources.

          The BCaT Network features resources from TIP, Texas Department of
          State Health Services, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
          Coalition Works, and many others.


          Immunization coalitions will have the opportunity to learn from other
          members through discussion board posts and shared resources.
          Additionally, each coalition will have their own page within the BCaT
          Network to interact with their members. TIP Staff created a&nbsp;[BCaT
          Network User
          Guide](https://www.immunizeusa.org/static/custom/img/resources/bcat-network-user-guide.pdf){:
          target="_blank"}&nbsp;as a resource to learn the features of the
          Network. TIP developed helpful guides and toolkits for coalition
          growth and sustainability available for free download.Over the last
          few years TIP’s coalition capacity building efforts have included:


          * Conducting strategic planning workshops for the Vaccine Awareness
          Coalition in Gregg County and Andrews County Immunization Coalition in
          Andrews County to help each coalition establish an action plan with
          goals and objectives.

          * Aided the Immunization Coalition of Greater Houston write a
          communications plan and conduct their first Legislative Luncheon with
          about 60 attendees.

          * Helped the El Paso Immunization Coalition conducted their first
          Immunization Conference in 2018.

          * Presented at the 2017 Texas Immunization Conference with the chair
          of the Vaccine Awareness Coalition on Immunization Coalition Capacity
          Building.

          * Collaborated with six immunization coalitions across the state to
          provide a SWOT analysis assessment, coalition-capacity workshops and
          webinars, and updated toolkits.

          * Distributed the Event Planning Guide which assists new and emerging
          immunization coalitions in building their capacity to improve and
          sustain high immunization rates through hosting community events.

          * Distributed the Communications which addresses strategies on how to
          interact with traditional media and tips on engaging the community
          through social media.
