      text: >-
        Texans want to be protected from disease. Vaccine Champions from across
        the state help us advocate for public policy that protects our fellow
        citizens against preventable disease through increased immunization
        access and rates.<br /><br />We will engage and activate pro-vaccine
        influencers in key communities to inspire fact-based vaccine
        decision-making through trusted sources. Our work is focused on
        inclusivity, equity, and safety for all Texans.

      card_title: The Flu is Back in Texas
      text: >-
        The Immunization Partnership (TIP) evolved from a partnership originally
        dedicated to supporting the Houston-Harris County Immunization
        Registry.<br /><br />In response to a measles epidemic in the 1990's,
        <strong><a
        href="https://thesocialbook.com/treasure-awards/dr-ralph-feigin-in-memoriam/">Dr.
        Ralph Feigin</a></strong> founded the Houston-Harris County Immunization
        Registry (HHCIR), so that providers could better assess the immunization
        status of children and treat them accordingly. In 2008, this local
        registry was transitioned to the statewide system called <strong><a
        href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunize/immtrac/default.shtm">ImmTrac</a></strong>,
        and Dr. Feigin's ultimate goal of providing one consolidated database of
        immunizations for Texas was achieved. The HHCIR Board of Directors
        determined that an even larger impact could be made to increase
        immunization rates in the community, so a decision was made to expand
        its range of services. The Board developed a new name, <a
        href="https://immunizeusa.org/"><strong>The Immunization
        Partnership</strong></a>, and a new mission that truly reflected the
        broader scope of the organization.<br /><br /><a target="_blank"
