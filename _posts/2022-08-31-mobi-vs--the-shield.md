## ***Mobi vs. The Shield: ***

## ***Community Immunity Saves the Day***

The Immunization Partnership created a children's book to explain community immunity and the importance of keeping those who are unable to receive vaccines safe from harm. The book follows Mobi, a pesky measles virus, who has a goal of infecting everyone in Townsville. However, a superhero vaccine named Victor quickly throws a wrench in Mobi's plans. The reader goes on an exciting adventure with Mobi and Victor as they explore several different situations about community immunity.

**Mobi vs. The Shield** was written by TIP staff and illustrated by Leslie Harrington, the new illustrator for Highlights Magazine's popular, long-running Goofus and Gallant series.

This book would not have been possible without the generosity of Ronald McDonald House Charities and Peter Hotez, MD, PhD, Community Health Choice, and the Rotary Club of Houston.

**Mobi vs. The Shield: Community Immunity Saves the Day** is available in both English and Spanish.
