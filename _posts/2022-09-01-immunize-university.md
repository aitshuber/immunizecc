The Immunization Partnership now offers professional continuing education credit through Immunization University (IZU). This new online platform provides free nursing educational courses/modules, which include information about immunizations and vaccine-preventable diseases. The professional continuing education credit for nursing-approved credits is through a partnership with Cizik School of Nursing at UTHealth. Non-Continuing Education courses are open to individuals in other professions and to students.
