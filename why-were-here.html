		    Despite having vaccines that prevent more than 20 life-threatening diseases, those diseases have not gone away. The number of people receiving routine vaccinations has dropped for the first time in a decade. Texas is ground-zero for the anti-vaccination movement, putting our children and our communities at great risk for disease outbreaks, such as measles and chicken pox.&nbsp;<br /><br />More Texas families are opting their children out from one or more school required vaccines, leading to an increase in vaccine exemptions. The Department of State Health Services reports families filed more than 76,000 vaccine exemptions for one or more school required vaccines in the 2021-22 school year.
