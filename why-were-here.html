        Despite having vaccines that prevent more than 20 life-threatening
        diseases, those diseases have not gone away. The number of people
        receiving routine vaccinations has dropped for the first time in a
        decade. Texas is ground-zero for the anti-vaccination movement, putting
        our children and our communities at great risk for disease outbreaks,
        such as measles and chicken pox.&nbsp;


        More Texas families are opting their children out from one or more
        school required vaccines, leading to an increase in vaccine exemptions.

          Lack of easy access to vaccines continues to affect vaccination rates,
          but misinformation campaigns about COVID-19 vaccination has spilled
          over to further deter routine immunizations.&nbsp;

        text: >-
          Immunization rates vary greatly between certain segments of the
          stateâ€™s population. Lack of community outreach and systems to deliver
          vaccines results in disparities that threaten public health.

        text: >-
          Vaccine deniers, with the help of statewide political operatives, have
          built a power base in Texas. Their legislative agenda includes
          elimination of required immunizations that have kept Texas children
          safe for generations.
