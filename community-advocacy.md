          Immunization has protected the health of Texans for generations.
          Despite that long, successful history, immunization has, in recent
          years, been politicized more than ever. The spread of misinformation
          about vaccines is dangerous, and puts our state’s health at risk.We
          cannot afford to lose ground in our effort to protect people from
          preventable disease. The more people across the state that help
          educate others about the benefits of immunization, the less likely we
          are to face resurgences of diseases like measles, mumps, and
          meningitis. The more people, like you, who become part of our BOOST
          TEXAS team, the more helpful, factual information we can provide to
          more people in more communities…and the more lives we can save.
