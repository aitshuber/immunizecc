      Immunization has protected the health of Texans for generations. Despite
      that long, successful history, immunization has, in recent years, been
      politicized more than ever. The spread of misinformation about vaccines is
      dangerous, and puts our state’s health at risk.We cannot afford to lose
      ground in our effort to protect people from preventable disease. **The
      more people across the state that help educate others about the benefits
      of immunization, the less likely we are to face resurgences of diseases
      like measles, mumps, and meningitis**. The more people, like you, who
      become part of our team, the more helpful, factual information we can
      provide to more people in more communities…and the more lives we can save.
